# A Multi-FoV Viewport-based Visual Saliency ModelUsing Adaptive Weighting Losses for 360◦Images

## Abstract
360° media allows observers to explore the scene inall directions. The consequence is that the human visual attentionis guided by not only the perceived area in the viewport but alsothe overall content  in 360◦. In this  paper, we propose a methodto estimate the 360◦saliency map which extracts salient featuresfrom  the  entire  360◦image  in  each  viewport  in  three  differentField of Views (FoVs). Our model is first pretrained with a large-scale  2D  image  dataset  to  enable  the  interpretation  of  semanticcontents, then fine-tuned with a relative small 360◦image dataset.A  novel  weighting  loss  function  attached  with  stretch  weightedmaps is introduced to adaptively weight the losses of three eval-uation  metrics  and  attenuate  the  impact  of  stretched  regions  inequirectangular projection during training process. Experimentalresults demonstrate that our model achieves better performancewith  the  integration  of  three  FoVs  and  its  diverse  viewportimages. Results also show that the adaptive weighting losses andstretch  weighted  maps  effectively  enhance  the  evaluation  scorescompared  to  the  fixed  weighting  losses  solutions.  Comparing  toother  state  of  the  art  models,  our  method  surpasses  them  onthree  different  datasets  and  ranks  the  top  using  5  performanceevaluation  metrics  on  the  Salient360!  benchmark  set
